Hi folks❗

This is Lane Art Design. 🏝️ 

We decided to open our website source code for the Community. 💪

With this we pretend to:
1. Accept new ideas by anyone willing to participate
2. Be known by the Community

## Installation
Install [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), open a terminal, clone the repository by typing:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Lane-Art-Design/LaneArtDesignResponsiveWeb.git
```
Make sure you have installed the [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) tool.

Then navigate to the new folder:
```shell
cd cyberfutureWebsite
```
and install all dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
then type:
```shell
npm run dev
```
Make sure that you have already installed the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/).
Finally, open the browser at http://localhost:3000/ for visualizing the website.
